# Serial No. 3 – Monitor Network Traffic

## Objective
Capture and analyze network traffic to understand common protocols and identify unusual or suspicious activity.

## Tool Used
- **Wireshark** – a network protocol analyzer for capturing and inspecting packets.

## Protocols Observed

| Protocol | Description | Observations |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| TCP      | Reliable communication used in web browsing and apps | Normal traffic |
| TLS      | Encrypted web traffic (HTTPS) | Normal, secure |
| UDP      | Lightweight communication, often for streaming or gaming | Normal |
| MDNS     | Local device discovery on the network | Normal, expected from connected devices |
| ARP      | Address Resolution Protocol, maps IP to MAC addresses | Normal LAN activity |
| QUIC     | Google’s fast web protocol for web traffic | Normal |
| DNS      | Domain Name System lookups | Normal |
| ICMP     | Pings and network testing | Minimal, normal |

---

## Analysis
- No unusual IP addresses or suspicious protocols detected.  
- MDNS shows local devices connected to the network.  
- ICMP and ARP packets indicate normal connectivity checks and LAN mapping.  
- TCP, TLS, UDP, and QUIC traffic corresponds to expected usage of web browsing and apps.
