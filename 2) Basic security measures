# Serial No. 2 â€“ Implementing Basic Security Measures

## Objective
Set up basic security measures on a network to prevent unauthorized access and secure data.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Windows Defender Firewall
- **What was done:** Enabled the firewall for both Public and Private networks.
- **Test:** Blocked access for a specific application (Microsoft Edge) to simulate unauthorized access.
- **Why:** Prevents unknown apps or devices from accessing the network, reducing the risk of malware or hacking.

### 2. Secure Hotspot / Passwords
- **What was done:** Enabled a secure password on the mobile hotspot.
- **Why:** Default passwords are predictable; setting a strong password prevents unauthorized devices from connecting.

### 3. Network Encryption
- **What was done:** Enabled WPA2/WPA3 (if available) on the hotspot.
- **Why:** Encrypts all traffic to prevent eavesdropping and protect sensitive information.

## Notes
- No physical router was used; the mobile hotspot acted as the network environment.
- Testing of firewall rules was done by blocking Microsoft Edge to simulate unauthorized access.
- Even with a simple network, these measures provide a foundational layer of security.

## Reflection
Implementing these basic measures helped me understand:
- How firewalls act as gatekeepers for network traffic.
- The importance of changing default credentials and securing the network.
- Why encryption is critical to prevent data interception.
