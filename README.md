## 1️⃣ Learning Network Security Basics

# a) Network Threats

1) Viruses

- What they are: Viruses are malicious programs that attach themselves to files or applications. They only do damage when the infected file is opened or executed.
- How they spread: Through downloads, email attachments, USB drives, or infected software.
- Impact: Can slow down your system, delete files, or even corrupt your operating system.
- Example from my study: I read about the ILOVEYOU virus that took place on May 2000, which spread through email attachments and caused billions in damage worldwide.

2) Worms

- What they are: Unlike viruses, worms can self-replicate and spread across networks without any action from the user.
- Impact: They can overload networks, steal data, or create backdoors for other attacks.
- Example: The WannaCry ransomware worm in 2017 spread through vulnerable Windows systems, encrypting files and demanding ransom.

3) Trojans

- What they are: Malicious programs disguised as legitimate software.
- Impact: Can steal sensitive data, create backdoors, or let hackers remotely control your system.
- Example: A fake software installer that claims to speed up your computer but secretly installs malware.

4) Phishing Attacks

- What they are: Attacks that trick people into giving up sensitive info like passwords or bank details.
- How they work: Usually via fake emails, messages, or websites that look real.
- Impact: Identity theft, stolen money, or hacked accounts.
- Example from my research: Receiving a fake “bank alert” email asking to log in via a malicious link.

# b) Basic Security Concepts

1) Firewalls

- What it is: A firewall acts as a gatekeeper between your internal network and the internet.
- Purpose: It blocks unauthorized access and allows safe traffic to pass.
- Example: Windows Defender Firewall blocking an unknown app trying to access the internet.

2) Encryption

- What it is: Encryption is converting data into a coded format that only authorized users can read.
- Purpose: Protects sensitive information during transmission.
- Example: HTTPS on websites encrypts the data you send (like passwords) so hackers can’t read it if intercepted.

3) Secure Network Configurations

- What it means: Simple settings that make your network safer.
- Examples:
Changing default router passwords, Enabling Wi-Fi encryption (WPA2/WPA3), Closing unused ports to reduce attack surfaces
- Why it matters: Even basic changes can prevent attackers from exploiting common vulnerabilities.

# c) Personal Takeaways / Reflection

- Understanding these threats helps me see why even simple security practices are important.
- Small steps, like changing passwords or checking links before clicking, go a long way in keeping a network secure.
- I also realized that threats evolve quickly, so learning to identify them early is the key.
