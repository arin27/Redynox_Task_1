# Serial No. 4 â€“ Document Findings

## Objective
Summarize network threats researched, security measures implemented, and findings from traffic monitoring.

## Network Threats Recap
- **Viruses:** Malicious programs that attach to files and cause damage. Example: ILOVEYOU virus.  
- **Worms:** Self-replicating malware spreading without user action. Example: WannaCry ransomware.  
- **Trojans:** Malicious programs disguised as legitimate software. Example: Fake software installer.  
- **Phishing Attacks:** Tricking users to reveal sensitive information via fake emails or websites.

## Security Measures Implemented
1. **Windows Defender Firewall**
   - Enabled for both Public and Private networks.  
   - Blocked Microsoft Edge as a test for unauthorized access.  
2. **Mobile Hotspot Security**
   - Set a strong password.  
   - Enabled WPA2/WPA3 encryption for data protection.  

**Why:** These measures provide a basic but solid defense against unauthorized access and data interception.

## Traffic Captured with Wireshark
- Captured TCP, TLS, UDP, DNS, MDNS, ARP, QUIC, and ICMP protocols.  
- Observed normal traffic for browsing, apps, and local device discovery.  
- No suspicious or unusual IP addresses were detected.
